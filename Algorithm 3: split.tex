The syntax of Algorithmic is a little more complicated than Algorithm2e\\
However it's useful to deal with split algorithms\\
Algorithmic save the indentation and the open environments of the algorithm and it saves them using algstore{ <var name> }\\
After a new algorithm environment is opened, to continue the previous algorithm is as simple as invoke algrestore{ <var name> }
